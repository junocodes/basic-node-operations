1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain output:

Sort: Returns file with lines sorted alphabetically. 
WC: Returns the line, word, and byte counts for the file. 
Uniq: Returns uniq lines from files removing all duplicate lines.  

2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain output:

I piped wc and head together. Since the file was largely reduced due to the 'head' command, it reduced the results to 10 lines, 24 words, and 211 bytes. 

6. Reverse Words in String:

Method One: 
let inputString = "I'm learning to program algorithms!"

const reverseString = (inputString) => {
    let splitString = inputString.split("");
    let reversedStore = [];
    splitString.forEach((element) => {
        reversedStore.push(element);
    });
    reversedStore.reverse();
    let reversedString = reversedStore.join("");
    return reversedString;
}

console.log(reverseString(inputString));

--- ---

Method Two: 
let inputString = "I'm learning to program algorithms!"

function reverseString(inputString) {
  return inputString.split("").reverse().join("").split(" ").reverse().join(" ")  
}

console.log(reverseString(inputString));
